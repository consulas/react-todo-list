# react-todo-list

This is a simple todo list app built with React, Redux and Webpack. I built this app during my [tutorial series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQDnxXqV213JJFtDaG0aE9vqvp6Wm7nBg).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run serve`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
